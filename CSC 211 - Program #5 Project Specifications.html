			<b>Objectives:</b>

		<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size=2>
The main objective of the final project is for you to choose a <i>substantial</i> problem and to carry out its programming solution through the process of design, documentation, implementation and testing.
<br>
As part of that process, and most importantly, you will have to apply the principles of modularity and program decomposition introduced with the previous programs when defining the necessary classes for this program.
<p>
As always, in order to complete this assignment, feel free to use and/or copy any document available from the CSC211 web pages.

			<b>Assignment:</b>
		</font></td>

		<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size=2>
The final project consists of carrying out a number of tasks to specify, implement, and document a large problem and its solution.
<ul type="circle">
	
	<li>	You will need to specify precisely how you will solve the problem, i.e., how you will decompose the problem into modules that handle different parts of the problem. </li>
	<li>	You will need to develop, implement, test, and debug these modules. </li>
	<li>	Finally you will need to bring everything together to solve the original problem in full.
</ul>
Each of the design and implementation steps should be accompanied with <b>complete documentation</b>.

			<b>Requirements:</b>
		</font></td>

		<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size=2>
A project should provide a clear illustration of the concepts and techniques that have been introduced in class:  modularity, avoiding code replication, clarity and reliability.
The final version of the project must be fully documented, not just with comments throughout the program, but with an external documentation report and a "user's manual."
<p>
A project <b>must</b> be implemented using a number of separate modules/units/classes.
Each module <b>must</b> have a well defined functionality and very precise documentation.
A project <b>must</b> include <b>all</b> of the following:
<ul type="circle">
	<li>	an array to hold a number of objects of a datatype you have defined;
	<li>    operations on that array, one of which must be at least as complex as sorting;
	<li>	class inheritance that you have defined; [this requirement cannot be met by extending a class in the Java API or by using an inheritance hierarchy that has already been implemented (e.g. in labs)]  
	<li>	user interaction;
	<li>	graphical interface.
</ul>

See <a href="project options.pdf">here</a> the list of preapproved options. You may upload an alternate proposal to the Proposal Assignment for approval.

<b>Project description:</b>
<br>
This should consist of a couple of pages of plain English description of the programming project, including what the program is intended to do, how it will interface with the user, the expected input and the projected output or results.
The project description should be very precise, and could profit from examples to illustrate how the program will actually work.
This project description should <b>NOT</b> include how the program will be implemented; it should only describe what the program will do, and it should be independent of its implementation. The project description <b>does</b> need to include an explanation of how the project will meet <b>each</b> of the <b>five</b> requirements.
<p>
This documentation should be in your Sakai Final Project Proposal Assignment by the due date. A hard copy is not needed.
Feedback (approval or request for changes) will be given as soon as possible after the proposal is received.

<b>Project specification and initial documentation:</b>
<br>
Preferably Javadoc documentation, or alternately the source files themselves with declarations and constructor and method headers, but without any implementation, for each of the modules in your program. Your documentation should make clear the relationship between these modules as well as the functionality of each module. It should include the definition of all constructors and methods as well as the definition of all instance (and class) variables and references. Each declaration should be accompanied by a precise description.
<p>
The description of each module should not include how each function is implemented, but what precisely it does. It should be clear from the documentation how the modules and methods within fit together.  
<p>
In addition, include a testing plan saying what you intend to test, with what range of input, and how you intend to do the testing.
<p>
This documentation should be in your Sakai Final Project Part 1: Specifications Assignment by the due date. A hard copy is not needed.

<b>Working prototype:</b>

The prototype should include the partial implementation of most of the modules.
All modules not yet fully implemented should still include the simulated implementation of all definitions in their interface.
The prototype should be running.
It should not nessarily give all complete results, but it should give a clear idea of the final result.

<b>Project specification and initial documentation:</b>
<br>
A precise description of all modules in the project explaining the functionality of each module in general terms, and the precise description of each constructor, method and data member introduced in the module.
<p>
Javadoc files are the best format for submitting the specifications, and the only acceptable alternative are the source files themselves, without any implementation. The comments you make for each method must specify very precisely what it does, including any side-effects (like changing the values of instance variables). Remember to comment each data member, explaining its role. If a method is a helper method, indicate which methods you anticipate will invoke that method in order to do their jobs.  For the comments at the top of the class, be sure to explain what that class is, what capabilities it has and how it interrelates with other classes in the program.
<p>
In addition, submit a testing plan indicating what will be tested and how.

<b>Final project and final documentation:</b>
<br>
Submit the source files for all the modules of a working (and complete) project.  Your project must be a Java application that can be compiled and run in Eclipse. (No .jar files, no programs intended for a mobile platform that can't be run on a pc, no programs that run on a remote server and require network communication.)  
<p>
In addition to a fully commented program, you should submit a complete external documentation explaining how your program works.
The documentation should include the final specifications: a description explaining the functionality of each module, how each module interrelates with other modules and how each module is used by the main program or other modules.  The specifications must match the code, so if your code does not follow the specifications you submitted for part 2, you must update those specifications.
<p>  
The documentation must also include a user's manual explaining how to run the program.
This could profit from actual examples produced by the program.
<p>
Finally, your submission must include a document explaining what you tested, with what input, how you did the testing and what were the results.
<p>
The final project and all documentation should be uploaded in your <b>Sakai Final Project Part 2 Assignment</b>.  (Note, we do not need hard copies.)
